Hi 👋 my name is Sebastiaan Janssen
====================================

Developer Advocate at Umbraco
--------------------------------

From fostering contributions to learning what makes our developer community tick ☑️, to hosting a weekly open coding session to making coffee ☕ for colleagues. I do it all. But I do need my kayak 🛶 sessions and live music 🎸too. Remember live music, from the before times?
